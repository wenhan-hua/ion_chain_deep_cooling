## Motivation
    -  Micromotion affects the lineshape felt by an ion, which makes the doppler cooling inefficient.
    -  A PHD thesis from Monroe's group metioned an additional laser(named deep cooling laser) is needed to make the ion chain become a crystal. 
    - Only a 1st-order deep cooling laser is recorded now, the typical freqency is a red-detuned of the micromotion sideband by a few MHz

## Results
    - According to the PHD thesis from Monroe's group, without deep cooling they are able to load many 10â€™s of ions, but with deep cooling, they are able to load up to 77 ions in a 3-layer trap.
